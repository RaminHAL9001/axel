  - When I tried to `cabal build` after returning from break, it refused to compile (for reasons that came out-of-nowhere0, and I think it's because I hadn't actually pinned the version of GHC I want to use. (Stack includes the GHC version in the snapshot, and I had neglected to pin that when I migrated to Cabal.) While I was at it, I decided to upgrade GHC and played around a bit with dependency package versions until I was able to get everything to build. From there, I seemed to have made it back to where I had left off before break.
  - Keep working on the Polysemy issue. I've moved on to trying to coax GHC (via `unsafeCoerce`) to accept logical constraints. I don't know very much about how type families work in GHC, so I've asked on the Haskell subreddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/emj06h/force_ghc_to_accept_constraint/) and seem to be making progress. Currently, my conversation with TheMatten seems the most promising, since judging from their username, they're actually a Polysemy maintainer! I'm currently waiting for them to respond with any further hints.

  - Finish migrating bootstrapping-critical functionality to Cabal 3.

  - [WIP] I now believe the issue from last week is a bug in Polysemy after all (involving polysemy-research/polysemy#114 and existential types). Regardless, I've spent way too much time on this issue, so I've tried to bake in the fact that `Sem.Reader ExpansionId` must be the first item in `openEffs`. This... also doesn't work, and I'm not sure why. It's likely my mistake, but reasoning about this (and pinpointing errors) is very difficult (for me, at least). See stash 46f7170d3106d46dad25c67e1b88fa5dd1cb4431. Next week, I am going to try to, instead of only prepending `firstEff` to `openEffs` in the constraint, also do so in the result type effects list.
  - [WIP] Began migrating to Cabal 3. Migrating the basic infrastructure itself was trivially easy (much more so than I had expected), but I forgot about what this would mean for Axel's usage of Stack under-the-hood! Specifically, since Axel relies on projects using Stack, it's not able to compile itself anymore. I don't think it'll be particularly difficult to replace the Stack dependency with one on Cabal (in e.g. the project generation code), but it'll probably be time-consuming.

  - [WIP] Still working on the issue from last week. However, there's a good chance it's actually not a bug in Polysemy after all (but I'm continuing the conversation with @isovector to try to fully understand what's going wrong).
  - Researched how to integrate the PureScript compiler. I'm having difficulty getting `purescript` to install via Stack(age). Now that Cabal 3.0.0 has been released, it might finally be time to switch to Cabal for good.

  - [WIP] Continued work from last week. While wiring everything up, Polysemy became very, very unhappy. I spent some time trying to figure out what I was doing wrong, but with no luck. Eventually, I ended up removing `Sem.Reader (Backend backendEffs)` altogether in favor of just passing `Backend backendEffs` around as a parameter. I've since been running into what I think is a variation of https://github.com/polysemy-research/polysemy/issues/280 (which I opened yesterday after finding an MVCE).
    I'm not too great with typeclass-fu, so this is taking a bit longer than I had anticipated (unfortunately).

  - [WIP] Break out Haskell-specific code in `Axel.Macros` into a `Backend` interface. Adapt `Axel.File` to use this new system.
